        Thanks for visiting! I haven't put any effort into this front page yet, as my main focus is
        on my <a href="/apps/thumbtack/">Thumbtack web-app</a>. Note that as of writing no beta has
        been deployed there.

        sounding stupid (anyone who has met me in real life would know this) :)</p>

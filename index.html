    <h3>Website development roadmap</h3>
    <p>
        Hey all (people who randomly found my website)! Here's the roadmap for website development.
        Note that while this is an ordered list, things may happen out of order.
        <ol>
            <li>Thumbtack rudimentary functionality</li>
            <li>Basic styling (white and black is pretty ugly)</li>
            <li>Account system</li>
            <li>Dynamic news system (I'm manually adding these news entries to the code right now)</li>
            <li>News entry bookmarking and subscription (recieve email updates)</li>
            <li>Responsiveness (basically mobile support, low on the list because most accesses are
                through larger screens such as laptops)
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>Under construction</h3>
    <p>
        Thanks for visiting! I haven't put any effort into this front page yet, as my main focus is
        on my <a href="/apps/thumbtack/">Thumbtack web-app</a>. Note that as of writing no beta has
        been deployed there.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: small;">The name is supposed to be silly and nonsensical, I'm great at
        sounding stupid (anyone who has met me in real life would know this) :)</p>
